- In this whole system, Here a pharmacy can register for sale a post in the sell section by searching ndc 
and adding the posts.In his account section he can see his own post in my-posting section, 
and he can edit or delete that post.Also, that pharmacy can see his profile 
and update his password or also can reset that password too.If he gets any 
order from another pharmacy, he can update their order status or generate an
invoice in sell order section.


- On the other hand, For buying a post pharmacy also need to log in and register 
first.After registration, he/she will get a mail where they get a temporary
information for login.After approved pharmacy registration,pharmacies need to 
update this password that is provided by the admin.Then pharmacy can see the 
post list for buying.The pharmacy can see the all post that is created by the 
other pharmacies,on the same time you can select a post from one pharmacy at a time.After 
select the post, now you can place the order by pay to card or bank.
